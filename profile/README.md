## Overview

Reputable.Network allows for the decentralized aggregation, validation, and attestation of reputation data, supporting a customizable approach for protocols and developers aiming to establish and monetize their reputation within the ecosystem. By blending data from both Web2 and Web3 sources, Reputable delivers a hybrid, transparent, and objective reputation model to enhance trust and transparency in decentralized systems.

### Key Features

- **Customizable Reputation Models**: Deploy personalized models that reflect the unique needs and metrics of your community or application.
- **Sybil-Resistant Attestations**: Use a combination of on-chain and off-chain data to mint a trustless and on-chain reputation score.
- **Monetize Reputation Model**: List your models on the Reputable Hub to allow others to leverage and reward your custom Model.
- **Decentralized Data Validation**: A network of Reputable nodes ensures the integrity of reputation data through a consensus mechanism.
