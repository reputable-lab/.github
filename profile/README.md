Reputable.Network is a decentralized reputation protocol that enables developers and protocols to create, customize, and monetize on-chain reputation models. Leveraging both on-chain and off-chain data, Reputable provides a comprehensive, sybil-resistant scoring framework tailored to the needs of Web3 protocols, DAOs, and developers.


**## Overview**

Reputable.Network allows for the decentralized aggregation, validation, and attestation of reputation data, supporting a customizable approach for protocols and developers aiming to establish and monetize their reputation within the ecosystem. By blending data from both Web2 and Web3 sources, Reputable delivers a hybrid, transparent, and objective reputation model to enhance trust and transparency in decentralized systems.


**### Key Features**

- **Customizable Reputation Models**: Deploy personalized models that reflect the unique needs and metrics of your community or application.
- **Sybil-Resistant Attestations**: Use a combination of on-chain and off-chain data to mint a trustless and on-chain reputation score.
- **Monetizable Reputation Model Registry**: List your models on the Reputable Hub to allow others to leverage and reward your custom Model.
- **Decentralized Data Validation**: A network of Reputable nodes ensures the integrity of reputation data through a consensus mechanism.


**### Core Components**

**Data Aggregation (Web2 and Web3)**: Collects and aggregates data from both Web2 and Web3 environments, providing comprehensive insights to support the reputation scoring.

**EAS_Registry (Reputation Attestations Contract)**: Manages the issuance and verification of reputation attestations, ensuring that all data inputs to the reputation models are authentic and trustworthy.

**Reputable Hub_Contract (Reputation Models Registry)**: Hosts and organizes customizable reputation models created by protocols and developers. Models deployed here can be shared across dApps, allowing creators to earn rewards.

**Reputable Protocol (Trusted Compute)**: The core computation layer where reputation data is processed and validated. This layer interacts with the EAS_Registry to verify data and with the Reputable Hub to manage reputation models.


**### How It Works**

- **Data Collection**: Aggregated from both Web2 and Web3 sources, data flows into the protocol where it undergoes validation.
- **Attestation and Validation:** Verified data is sent to the EAS_Registry to receive attestations, ensuring its authenticity.
- **Reputation Model Creation**: Developers and protocols design custom reputation models, defining weights and parameters based on specific criteria.
- **Deployment and Monetization**: The created model is deployed to the Reputable Hub_Contract, allowing it to be accessed and monetized by other protocols.
- **Model Execution**: Smart contracts execute the model across dApps, where protocols can leverage trusted reputation data to inform decisions or provide incentives.
- **Cross-dApp Integration**: Models can be shared and reused across different decentralized applications, with fees distributed between Reputable and model creators.
