## Overview

Reputable.Network is a decentralized protocol designed to aggregate, validate, and attest to reputation data, enabling Web3 protocols to build fully customizable on-chain reputation models tailored to their unique needs. By leveraging both on-chain and off-chain data, Reputable facilitates the creation of hybrid reputation models that empower protocols to identify and reward impactful contributors, foster trust, and optimize resource allocation across decentralized ecosystems. Additionally, Reputable introduces a monetization layer, transforming reputation models into valuable, tradable assets, driving innovation and collaboration within Web3.

### Key Features

- **Customizable Reputation Models**: Deploy personalized models that reflect the unique needs and metrics of your community or application.
- **Sybil-Resistant Attestations**: Use a combination of on-chain and off-chain data to mint a trustless and on-chain reputation score.
- **Monetize Reputation Model**: List your models on the Reputable Hub to allow others to leverage and reward your custom Model.
- **Decentralized Data Validation**: A network of Reputable nodes ensures the integrity of reputation data through a consensus mechanism.
- **Trustless Computation On-Chain**: Execute and verify reputation score calculations directly on-chain to ensure transparency and trustworthiness.
